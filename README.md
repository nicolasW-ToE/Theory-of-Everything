Here i present a physics thought experiment, that led somehow to a finished Theory of Everything by combining RT and QM through consciousness without the need for quantum effects in the brain. Six years ago i had a thought (like many other) that i followed with logic further and further to find the error in that thought experiment, but couldn't find any in all that time: 
"What if Einstein was more correct than he could have imagined, and everything is relative to the observer - even reality itself ?"
The mathematical framework presented here is a translation of that logical part into existing mathematical symbols (and a few new symbols) that somehow led to a world formula. A formula describing the sum of the energy potential of the entire (6D) universe by unifying all 5 (1 new) fundamental forces, making consciousness a measurable parameter, explaining why the higgs boson must have a mass (2 different attempts), while coincidentally finding a mathematical consistent solution how our world must have come to existance from nothing by explaining Dark Energy without the need for a new cosmological constant.
It delivers predictions that are different to the standard model, including predictions that have already been measured. I further present speculative but logical solutions for almost all major problems in modern cosmology based on this 6D Model.
After the logical and mathematical part here i will also present some philosophical consequences (for our worldview) of which i'm confident the math will confirm once the 6D-Einstein-Maxwell-Field equation has been fully solved on a supercomputer. 
In the appendix i will explain exactly how i figured out the parameters for this extension of the standard model with logic, quantum experiments on myself in the real world, while following scientific standards.
